[**OpenBangla Keyboard**](https://github.com/OpenBangla/OpenBangla-Keyboard): An OpenSource Bengali input method engine. I am the initial developer of this project. It is the first input method engine for Bengali on Linux with the features it got. I aiming to port it to macOS and on Windows. It actually imitates [Avro Keyboard](https://www.omicronlab.com/avro-keyboard.html). You can find most of the features present in Avro Keyboard and this makes OpenBangla Keyboard the first Bengali input method with the rich features available on Linux. Check it out!
